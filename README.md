# 🤖 High-Fidelity Restaurant ML Intelligence Suite
**Cognifyz Machine Learning Internship | Professional Dashboard Delivery**

An end-to-end, high-fidelity Machine Learning application designed to provide actionable insights and predictive analytics for the global restaurant industry. This suite features a custom-engineered Dark Mode UI and production-grade ML pipelines.

## 🚀 Core ML Modules

### 1. 📈 Predictive Rating Engine (Task 1)
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor.
* **Logic:** Analyzes complex non-linear relationships between pricing, popularity (votes), and service cost to predict aggregate user ratings.
* **Performance:** Real-time **R² Score** calculation and a **Prediction History** time-series visualization to monitor model variance.

### 2. 🍱 NLP-Powered Recommendation System (Task 2)
* **Vectorization:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert categorical cuisine data into numerical feature vectors.
* **Similarity Metric:** **Cosine Similarity** used to calculate the angular distance between restaurant profiles for hyper-relevant discovery.

### 3. 📊 Statistical Data Insights (Task 3)
* **Distribution Analysis:** Interactive visualization of price range frequencies.
* **Correlation Mapping:** Scatter plots exploring the interplay between 'Average Cost for Two' and 'Aggregate Rating'.

### 4. 📍 Geospatial Spatial Analysis (Task 4)
* **Coordinate Mapping:** Global distribution plotting using Latitude and Longitude data.
* **Data Cleaning:** Automated filtering of invalid coordinate pairs to ensure geospatial accuracy.
